# Housing-Price-Prediction---Regression-Regularization

Help an US based real estate company that has entered the Australian market to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of houses. 
Model: Regression/Regularization, Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
